# H1N1 and Seasonal Flu Vaccines Proyect

Project for the course Artificial Intelligence for Science and Engineering.

In this project, we will address the challenge of predicting the likelihood that individuals will be vaccinated against the H1N1 virus and seasonal flu, which is crucial in the field of public health to combat infectious diseases and prevent their spread.

## Data:

The data was downloaded directly from Kaggle and stored in this repository, which can be accessed using the following link:

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/elianasv/Proyecto-IA/main/H1N1_Flu_Vaccines.csv

And then read using the Pandas library and stored in a variable for use:

```
url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/elianasv/Proyecto-IA/main/H1N1_Flu_Vaccines.csv"
datos = pd.read_csv(url)
```
